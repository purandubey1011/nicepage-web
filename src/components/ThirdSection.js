                <div className='text-white text-left mt-3'>This is an obvious one given the competition, though also a somewhat awkward assertion given this writer’s history in calling out true wireless earbuds’ troubled past (and present, really). That said, new technology advancements such as improved Near Field Magnetic Induction (which connects earbuds through your skull) — as well as coming advancements in Bluetooth — have made it easier than ever to go wire-free.</div>

               <div className='max-w-xl pl-14 tracking-wide text-white text-justify'>Further, the fact that Google put all its battery tech, hardware, and controls inside the big black buds themselves — instead of in the cable like so many other wireless earbuds — means Google obviously wanted to make its first headphones totally wireless, but was unable (or unwilling) to trust its skills at cutting the final connection.
